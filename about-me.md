Hi!
I am Francesco and I am a PhD in Social Statistics and Demography at the University of Southampton, and a Doctoral Fellow at the MPIDR.

My research looks at the use of digital data for migration and transition to adulthood studies.
I hold a Master’s degree in Demography from Stockholm University, and a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from the University of Padova.

I attended the European Doctoral School of Demography between 2016 and 2017.
