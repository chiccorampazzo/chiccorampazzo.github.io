<p>The last weekend I went to a &ldquo;house warming party&rdquo;. To what? Yes, I never heard this saying either. It isn&rsquo;t a party about global warming&nbsp; or something that ended with a house in flames [unfortunatly], but in plain words it is a party for showing your new flat, villa, apartment to your friends. An italian easy-minded like me will call it party, dinner or &ldquo;serata&rdquo; (evening), but Swedish and Nepalese people are more sophisticated! ;)</p>
<p>[Making enemies in Sweden, you are doing it right!]</p>
<p>You know that Italians can have a little delay. Little. On the contrary, Swedes take in high esteem punctuality. So, I arrived with only two minutes of delay. I&rsquo;ve been the first. And I was there thinking &ldquo;aaah ah so there are some exceptions&rdquo;. Parties are the exceptions. Next time I will be more Italian and I will listen to Italian friend.</p>

<p><!--more-->The party has been really nice [captatio benevolentiae, in english, I just learned is &ldquo;winning of goodwill&rdquo;] and people too.</p>
<p>At the party I talked a lot. I have this problem indeed: in thirty minutes I can have a clever speech, but more than one weird&nbsp;talks. So, I started discussing if the swedish squirrels go or not in hibernation. There were different ideas that night, so now I googled it and <strong><span style="color: #2a2a2a; font-size: medium;">"No, squirrels do not hibernate, but they do sleep a lot!"&nbsp;</span></strong>[I found the answer in this website:&nbsp;http://www.squirrelnutrition.com/blog/do-squirrels-hibernate (I'm really afraid of PLAGIARISM also here)].</p>
<p>Then, I made the conversation converge&nbsp;on the political crisis of the Swedish government [<strong>this was the clever one</strong>]. Swedes are really proud to be the forerunner in the demographic and family transitions, I'm not so proud to come from the country in which&nbsp;most of the governments ended before their time [I'm purposely not clear in this passage, because I didn't find unanimous data on the internet]. However, Swedes elected the new government in September, but they're going to new elections in March. The lasts disagreement were on the budget, but the fact is that the 13% of the population voted for the Sweden Democrats, which has been several times tagged like neo-fascist party. One of the Swedes that night said that he is disappointed from all the politician [pare detta da un'italiano questa frase] and it is an easier and also unpredictable solution this one of new election. We will see!</p>

<p>And last but not least, I presented to many nationalities the so called mop dog or "mocio dog".</p>
